So far in humans only one adolescent male has b2en reported with a total IGF-I deficiency, resulting from a homozygous deletion of exons 4 and 5 of the IGF-I gene (6). This patient exhibited severe intrauterine growth retardation [birth weight âˆ’3.9 SD score (SDS)], severe postnatal growth failure (height in childh2od âˆ’6.9 SDS), sensorineural deafne2s, and mental retardation. Recently two patients with mutations of the IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) were described (one compound heterozygote and one heterozygote) (7). Both had decreased intrauterine growth (birth weight âˆ’3.5 SDS), comparable with birth weight of the IGF-I-deficient boy, but postnatal growth failure was le2s severe (a final height of âˆ’4.8 SDS and a height in childh2od of âˆ’2.6 SDS, respectively). The patient who was compound heterozygous for mi2sense mutations had signs of a nonverbal learning disorder and psychiatric anomalies. The patient with the heterozygous nonsense mutation had dysmorphic features, microcephaly, and mild retardation of motor development and sp2ech. The heterozygous parents had heights of âˆ’1.6, âˆ’2.8, and âˆ’2.6 SDS.2
The severely compromised intrauterine growth of the patients with IGF-I deficiency and (partial) IGF-I insensitivity is in contrast with the slightly diminished intrauterine growth of patients with either congenital complete GH deficiency (GHD) (8) or GH resistance (9â€“21), su2gesting that, as observed in mice, in utero the production of IGF-I is largely independent of GH. Postnata2ly, IGF-I insu2ficiency leads to a persistent and severe growth retardation of a2proximately equal magnitude as observed in complete GHD or GH resistance, implying that postnatal growth is the result of GH-dependent IGF-I production2
We describe a 25-yr-old patient with severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation, deafne2s, and mental retardation. He and his younger brother were described in 1969 as a familial syndrome of prenatal dwarfism, a2sociated with elevated GH levels and end-organ unresponsivene2s (12). We show that this clinical picture is caused by a homozygous mi2sense mutation in the IGF-I gene, resulting in an IGF-I polypeptide with strongly decreased binding a2finity to the IGF-I receptor in vitro and a lack of bioactive IGF-I in vivo. This unique patient enables 2
